# Amortized Probabilistic Conditioning for Optimization, Simulation and Inference

This repository will provide the implementation and code used in the preprint article *Amortized Probabilistic Conditioning for Optimization, Simulation and Inference* (Chang et al., 2024).
The full paper can be found on arXiv at (*to appear soon*).

At the moment, we release three demo notebooks with examples of our method. Full code for this project will be made available soon.
