# Amortized Probabilistic Conditioning for Optimization, Simulation and Inference

This repository will provide the implementation and code used in the preprint article *Amortized Probabilistic Conditioning for Optimization, Simulation and Inference* (Chang et al., 2024).
The full paper can be found on arXiv at (*to appear soon*).

## Demos

At the moment, we release three demo notebooks with examples of our method, the Amortized Conditioning Engine (ACE). Full code for this project will be made available soon.

- `1.MNIST_demo.ipynb`
- `2.BO_demo.ipynb`
- `3.SBI_demo.ipynb`

Each notebook demonstrates specific application of ACE. Simply open the notebooks in Jupyter or in GitHub to explore the demos.
